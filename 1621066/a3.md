# compress flatpak tars with xz instead of gzip
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1621066

## Diagnosis

- Currently the flatpaks packaging of Mozilla's products are still using `tar.gz` format. Of which while provide a slightly faster decompression time, lags behind of `LZMA` or `.xz` format in terms of compression size.
- Current file type does not comply with Mozilla's standard in-tree. The Goal is to change to `.xz` format.

## Solution

- Complete phabricator link: https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D66696
- Changed compression algorithm in [run.me](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/taskcluster/docker/firefox-flatpak/runme.sh#l124). [patch](https://patch-diff.githubusercontent.com/raw/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/pull/176.patch)
- Modified comments as well as error messages in [artifacts.py and flathub.py](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/scriptworker-scripts/pull/176/files) to correctly corresponds to the change in algorithm.

## Testing

- Mozilla's CI: https://firefox-ci-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/groups/PUocwpm-S1OqBme6-kkmzw
- Self-test: by compressing a file with similar size of that of firefox with both `.xz` and `.gz` formats. Comparing the two and wrote a short python test to extract the file. Both yields same SHA512 checksums.

## Screenshots

- The file is now compressed under LZMA's algorithm.
